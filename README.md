# Patrol-Station-Logo-Recognition
## Introduction
This is a Repository for beginner in Training a simple model with using 2 Method:
- MLPClassifier(Multilayers Perceptron)
- Pytorch (Deep Learning)
The second purpose for this repository is for author to recap the knolowdg about Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Flask is used in this project to build a local web-based interface for User Interaction.

## About the directory
`Interface` - Directory to include the Web-Based Interface Files
`Pytorch` - For Pytorch Method Related files
`Machine Learning` - For Machine Learning Method Related files, file is in Jupyter Notebook File Format

## About the Files
`CNN_Model` - The architecture of the CNN Model.  
`data_loader_ml` - For testing purpose, Load the dataset by looping and split the dataset using `sk-learn` library.  
`data_loader_pytorch` - Actual used method, Load the dataset using `torch` library.  
`pytorch_begineer` - This is a file that actual done the **Pre-Processing** and **Model Training**.  
The purpose of this repository it for the author to record and perform version control in his self-learning process.
